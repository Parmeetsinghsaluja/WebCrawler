Task 2
1. Enter the url you want to crawl
2. Enter the keyword 
3. The urls related to keyword are refined by searching for keyword in url or anchor tag text.
4. The variations were handled using this technique
       1. Studied the url structure of wikipedia
       2. It separates every word with "_" character.
       3.The keyword variation is handled by making use of above wikipedia's url structure.
       4. Links are browsed with the variation of upper ,lower and sentence case keywords.
       5. Links having second or third word as keyword are easily handled using link structure.
       6. Anchor tag text content are also checked so that links related to keyword should appear in the list.
       7. For example we take rain as a keyword and demonstrate the handling of variations.
       8. Only those links are selected which start with Rain or rain i.e links starting with "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain" 
           or "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rain".
       9. Links having "_rain" or "_Rain" or "_RAIN" in them are also selected.
       10. Links having rain or Rain as a word in anchor tag text are also selected.

As beautifulsoup  returns a soup object which has a tree structure and from that we can easily extract and html tag.
Firstly all irrelevant links are removed then we check for the links realted to the keyword.
The keyword is appended in links using concatination and then the every link is compared with this keyword-concatinated link.
The handling of lower and upper case is done through string functions like upper() and lower()
All the variations are implemented using concatination and string functions.
